# Telegram

The Telegram driver uses [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) with long polling to receive messages and the Bot API to send.

## Setup

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram and create a new bot with `/newbot`.
2. Copy the bot token it gives you.
3. Add the bot to your group and give it permission to read messages.
4. Get the group's chat ID (tip: forward a message to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot), or use the bot API `/getUpdates` endpoint).

## Config keys

Add under `telegram.<instance_id>` in `config.json`:

| Key | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bot_token` | Yes | — | Bot token from @BotFather |
| `max_file_size` | No | `52428800` (50 MB) | Maximum bytes per attachment when sending |
| `rich_header_host` | No | `"https://richheader.siiway.top"` | Base URL of your Cloudflare rich-header worker (see [Rich Header](#rich-header)) |
| `avatar_proxy_host` | No | — | Base URL of your Cloudflare avatar proxy worker (see [Avatar Proxy](#avatar-proxy)) |
| `photo_padding_color` | No | `"#000000"` | Padding color for extreme aspect ratio photos. Set to `null` to disable padding |
| `sanitize_accidental_mentions` | No | `true` | Insert zero-width space after `@` to prevent accidental Telegram mentions in bridged messages |
| `enable_recall` | No | `true` | Whether to enable message recall sync. When enabled: recalls from other platforms are applied to Telegram via `delete_message`, and you can reply to a message with `/recall` to actively notify a recall. Note: the Telegram Bot API **cannot automatically detect** user deletions, so the `/recall` command is used instead. Set to `false` to disable applying recalls and the `/recall` command. |
| `media_proxy` | No | — | Proxy URL used only when fetching media/attachments. Defaults to following `proxy` when unset. |
| `proxy` | No | — | Proxy URL for all Telegram API requests (e.g., `http://proxy.example.com:8080` or `socks5://proxy.example.com:1080`). Set to `null` to explicitly disable proxy for this instance (ignores global proxy setting). |

```json
{
  "telegram": {
    "tg_main": {
      "bot_token": "123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11",
      "max_file_size": 52428800,
      "rich_header_host": "https://richheader.siiway.top",
      "avatar_proxy_host": "https://tg-avatar-proxy.yourname.workers.dev"
    }
  }
}
```

## Rule channel keys

Use under `channels` or `from`/`to` in `rules.json`:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `chat_id` | Telegram chat ID. Use a negative number for groups (e.g. `"-1002206757362"`) |

```json
{
  "tg_main": { "chat_id": "-1002206757362" }
}
```

## Received message types

| Telegram type | Attachment type |
|---|---|
| Photo | `image` |
| Video | `video` |
| Voice | `voice` |
| Audio | `voice` |
| Document | `file` |
| Animation (GIF) | `video` |

Media messages may include a caption, which becomes the message text.

## Sending

| Attachment type | Telegram API method |
|---|---|
| `image` (GIF) | `send_animation` (keeps the animation) |
| `image` | `send_photo` |
| `voice` | `send_voice` |
| `video` | `send_video` |
| `file` | `send_document` |

The message text is sent as the caption of the first attachment. If there are no attachments (or all fail), it is sent as a plain `send_message`. Text for subsequent attachments is omitted.

## Rich Header

When a `msg_format` contains a `<richheader title="..." content="..."/>` tag and `rich_header_host` is configured, NextBridge shows a **small link-preview card** above the message text on Telegram. The card displays the sender's avatar, name (title), and a secondary line (content) — visually compact and distinct from the message body.

This works by serving a tiny HTML page with [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) meta tags from a Cloudflare Worker. Telegram fetches those tags and renders the result as a `prefer_small_media` link preview shown above the text.

### Cloudflare Worker setup

::: tip Public endpoint
We provide a public endpoint, `https://richheader.siiway.top`. Feel free to use it.
:::

1. Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Workers & Pages** → **Create**.
2. Paste the contents of [`cloudflare/richheader-worker.js`](https://github.com/siiway/NextBridge/blob/main/cloudflare/richheader-worker.js) into the editor and deploy.
3. Copy the worker's URL (e.g. `https://richheader.yourname.workers.dev`).
4. Set `rich_header_host` in your Telegram instance config to that URL.

### msg_format example

```json
{
  "my_tg": {
    "chat_id": "-100987654321",
    "msg": {
      "msg_format": "<richheader title=\"{user}\" content=\"id: {user_id}\"/> {msg}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Fallback behaviour

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `rich_header_host` is not set | Bold/italic HTML header prepended to the message text |
| Message includes media attachments | Same bold/italic HTML fallback (Telegram captions cannot carry link previews) |

## Avatar Proxy

When `avatar_proxy_host` is configured, NextBridge uses a Cloudflare Worker to proxy Telegram user avatars, avoiding exposure of the bot token in URLs. The worker only serves avatar images (jpeg, png, gif, webp) from paths starting with `photos/` or `profile_photos/`.

### Cloudflare Worker setup

1. Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Workers & Pages** → **Create**.
2. Paste the contents of [`cloudflare/tg-avatar-proxy.js`](https://github.com/siiway/NextBridge/blob/main/cloudflare/tg-avatar-proxy.js) into the editor and deploy.
3. Set the `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable in the worker settings (use the same bot token as your Telegram instance).
4. Copy the worker's URL (e.g. `https://tg-avatar-proxy.yourname.workers.dev`).
5. Set `avatar_proxy_host` in your Telegram instance config to that URL.

### Fallback behaviour

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `avatar_proxy_host` is not set | Avatar URLs are not included in messages |

## Message Edit Sync

When a Telegram message is edited, NextBridge detects the change and updates the corresponding bridged messages on other platforms.

Edits from other platforms are applied to Telegram using `edit_message_text`. If the message was originally sent with a rich-header link preview, the preview is reconstructed from the same `rich_header_host` URL during the edit. If `rich_header_host` is not set, a bold/italic HTML header is used as fallback.

Only text content is synced on edit. Media attachments cannot be replaced via the Telegram Bot API.

## Message Recall Sync

Recalls made on other platforms (Discord/QQ) are applied to Telegram via `delete_message`, removing the corresponding bridged message.

**Important limitation:** The Telegram Bot API **cannot detect** user message deletions — it pushes no deletion update. Therefore ordinary deletions **cannot** be detected automatically or bridged to other platforms.

**`/recall` command (recall notification):** As a workaround for the limitation above, **reply** to the message you want to recall and send `/recall` to actively notify NextBridge that a recall happened. NextBridge will:

- Bridge the recall to other platforms, deleting the corresponding bridged messages;
- Best-effort delete the original message on Telegram as well as the `/recall` command message itself (requires the bot to have delete permission — typically admin in the group — and the message to be within the deletable time window).

If `/recall` is sent without replying to a message, the bot replies with a usage hint.

Set `enable_recall` to `false` to disable applying recalls to Telegram, which also disables the `/recall` command.

## Notes

- Telegram bots cannot initiate conversations with users. Make sure the bot is already in the target group before running NextBridge.
- The bot's own messages are not echoed back (Telegram does not send bot message events to the bot itself).
